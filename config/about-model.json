Frolanguagesm here, I'd go on to dabble with Java as my go-to alternative for faster programming cycles, which eventually switched to python. The dramatic point of views between these communities always kept the spark of questioning motives. I would later get into web development due to market demands. From where I'd expand my javascript philosophy to different frameworks and highly specialized domains. From here the utilities and toolset became a vital part of my developer self and I'd get more masterful in the art of packaging a product. My projects had shifted dramatically in style, form and consistency. I still consider myself running in this phase with so much new occuring and all of that for making simpler interfaces for user and developer alike. I see all lot that can be improved in me and in the development paradigm and hence I strive to introduce a change that will propagate simplicity and beauty in code."
